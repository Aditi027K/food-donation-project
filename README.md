**Key Features:**
- All critical entities (Donors, Food Items, Pickups) are modeled as relational tables.
- Primary and Foreign Key constraints ensure data integrity.
- Cascade delete rules prevent orphan records.
- Efficient SQL queries enable real-time dashboard stats and filtering.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE food_donation_db;
USE food_donation_db;

CREATE TABLE donors (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    contact VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE food_items (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    donor_id INT NOT NULL,
    food_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    quantity VARCHAR(50),
    expiry_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (donor_id) REFERENCES donors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE pickups (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    food_id INT NOT NULL,
    pickup_person VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    pickup_time DATETIME,
